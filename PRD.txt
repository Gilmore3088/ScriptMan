1.1 Summary
ScriptMan is a tool to create, manage, and print detailed game-day production scripts for sporting events. It includes

A Season Dashboard to manage multiple seasons.
A Season Page for each season, listing multiple games.
Game Cards summarizing each game (opponent, date, sponsor, theme).
Add Season form for quick creation of new seasons.
A Show-Flow Editor (line-by-line script) that emphasizes a print-first workflow for event staff.
Integration with Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage) to store data and large files (up to 2GB).
1.2 Background & Context
Stadium operations often juggle spreadsheets and word documents to schedule sponsor reads, promotions, or band cues. This manual approach can be error-prone. ScriptMan simplifies these tasks by centralizing everything in a single system—season structure, games, and show-flow items—with robust print capabilities for game-day usage.

1.3 Objectives & Success Metrics
Objectives

Provide a drag-and-drop or table-based interface for creating and editing show-flow items.
Support multiple seasons and games within those seasons.
Emphasize print-friendly output for staff.
Allow large file attachments (up to 2GB) for Jumbotron videos, sponsor ads, etc.
Offer reusable components (sponsor reads) with global vs. local updates.
Success Metrics

Adoption Rate Number of stadiumsteams using ScriptMan.
Reduced Errors Fewer missed sponsor reads or scheduling conflicts.
Efficient Printing Streamlined process to produce multi-page show-flow PDFs.
Scalability System can handle many games, with hundreds of line items each.

2.2 Use Cases
Managing Multiple Seasons

As a Production Manager, I want a top-level dashboard of all seasons so I can quickly see which ones are active and add new ones.
Adding a New Season

As a user, I want a simple form to create a new season (title, sport, year), so I can start adding games.
Viewing a Season’s Games

As a user, I want to see all games within a season (dates, opponents, sponsors) so I can quickly jump in and edit each game’s show-flow.
Creating Show-Flow Items

As a Production Manager, I want to add line-by-line script items for sponsor reads, band appearances, promotions, and set them to specific times.
Printing the Show-Flow

As a Stadium Operator, I need a PDF with large, readable text that includes start times, sponsor text, location, and notes, so staff can use it on paper.
File Attachments

As a Production Crew Member, I attach images or PDFs for scoreboard visuals or stadium signage to each show-flow item.
