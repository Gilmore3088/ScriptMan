ScriptMan Brand Guide
1. Brand Identity
Brand Name: ScriptMan
Tagline (optional): “Your Game-Day Show-Flow Simplified”
Core Values:
Clarity: The design should focus on legibility and straightforward communication.
Dependability: Communicate trust and reliability for crucial game operations.
Efficiency: Reflect a modern, streamlined solution for stadium events.
2. Logo & Usage
Logo Concept

A simple wordmark reading “ScriptMan,” with a subtle icon (optional) that hints at a timeline or document.
The icon might be a small stylized clipboard, timeline bar, or a minimal checkmark representing a completed script.
Primary Logo

Wordmark: “ScriptMan” in a clean, sans-serif font.
Color: Dark charcoal or black for strong contrast on light backgrounds.
Icon Placement: If used, place to the left or integrated with the “S” in “ScriptMan.”
Clear Space

Keep a margin of at least 0.5x the logo’s height around all sides to avoid crowding.
Size & Scaling

Ensure the minimum width is not so small that letters become illegible (e.g., ~120px wide in digital contexts).
Maintain aspect ratio when resizing.
Logo Variants

Light Background Version: Black or dark charcoal text.
Dark Background Version: White text or a light neutral with the same proportions.
3. Color Palette
The color scheme prioritizes legibility, minimalism, and a neutral tone suitable for printing (both color and black-and-white).

Primary Color

Dark Charcoal (e.g., #2D2D2D or a near-black)
Used for text (headings, body) and key UI elements to ensure strong contrast.
Secondary / Accent Color

Steel Blue (e.g., #4A6FA5)
Subtly used for links, minor highlights, or small UI components to add visual interest without overwhelming.
Neutral Grays

Light Gray (#F5F5F5 or #EDEDED for backgrounds).
Mid Gray (#C4C4C4) for borders, inactive states, or dividing lines.
Success / Warning / Error (Optional)

Success: A subdued green (e.g., #5CB85C) for positive feedback.
Warning: A muted yellow/orange (e.g., #F0AD4E) for caution.
Error: A soft red (e.g., #D9534F) for errors.
Printing Consideration

Dark Charcoal text on white background remains clean in black-and-white prints.
Keep accent usage minimal so black-and-white printing still reads clearly.
4. Typography
Primary Font

A sans-serif font for both headings and body text (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans, or Arial).
This ensures high readability on screens and when printed.
Font Weights

Bold for headings (e.g., <h1>, <h2>).
Regular for body text.
Semibold or Medium can be used sparingly for subheadings or emphasis.
Hierarchy

H1: 24–32 px range (print-friendly), bold.
H2: 18–24 px, bold or semibold.
Body: 14–16 px for paragraphs, ensuring ~12–14 pt when printed.
Line Spacing

Slightly increased line-height (1.4–1.6) for better reading, especially in show-flow tables and printouts.
5. Layout & UI
General Layout

Clean, open spacing: 16–24 px margins around content blocks.
Minimal visual clutter: Rely on subtle lines, shapes, or whitespace to separate sections.
Navigation

Top Nav or Side Nav with simple text or minimal icons.
Keep the brand mark (logo) in the nav, top left corner.
Components

Buttons: Rounded or slightly squared corners, with primary color for primary actions (“Create Season”), secondary color for less critical actions.
Cards: Light gray backgrounds or outlines to group content (e.g., for a game card).
Show-Flow Table

Crisp grid lines in light gray (#EDEDED) to delineate columns.
Bold headings in the top row, 14–16 px for clarity.
Hover or selected row highlights in the secondary accent color (steel blue at 10–20% opacity).
Printing Focus

Ensure text remains black or dark charcoal for maximum clarity.
Avoid heavy blocks of color behind text that might cause legibility issues in black-and-white prints.
6. Iconography (Optional)
Style

Line-based or filled icons that are simple, with minimal detail.
Consistent stroke width or fill style.
Common Icons

Add / Plus: For creating new seasons, new games, etc.
Edit (pencil): For editing season or game details.
Print (printer icon): For PDF export or print action.
Duplicate (copy): If duplicating a game or show-flow.
Trash / Archive: For deleting or archiving.
Size & Usage

Typically 16–24 px in the UI; scale up for emphasis.
Keep color consistent with the brand’s accent or neutral palette.
7. Imagery & Photography (If Used)
Contextual Images

Sports stadium photos or stylized background images can be used sparingly in marketing pages, but keep the main UI mostly textual.
Avoid cluttered backgrounds on functional pages (like the show-flow editor), focusing on clarity.
Tone

Energetic but professional.
Photos that reflect stadium excitement, while the UI remains simple.
8. Brand Voice & Messaging
Voice

Professional, helpful, and concise—the system is used by time-pressed event staff.
Minimal jargon; direct, user-friendly language.
Copy Guidelines

Use short, clear sentences in the UI (e.g., “Create a new Season” or “Add Show-Flow Item”).
Provide helpful tooltips or placeholders where needed, but avoid overloading users with text.
9. Putting It All Together
Consistency

Reuse the same color, typography, and icon styles across all pages—Season Dashboard, Show-Flow Editor, Print Layouts, etc.
Keep the brand’s minimal aesthetic in both digital and printed materials.
Accessibility

Aim for high contrast (WCAG AA minimum). Dark charcoal on white typically passes.
Provide text alternatives for icons, especially in PDF exports if possible.
Examples

Buttons:
Primary: Dark Charcoal text on a subtle accent background (steel blue at 80–90% opacity), or vice versa if you prefer.
Secondary: White background, Dark Charcoal border.
Links: Steel Blue text with underline on hover.
Headings: “ScriptMan” wordmark or standard headings in the same sans-serif typeface.
Summary
The ScriptMan brand is clean, modern, and print-focused, leveraging:

Dark Charcoal for text
Steel Blue accent
Neutral Grays for backgrounds/borders
Sans-Serif typography (14–16 px for body text, 18–32 px for headings)
Minimal icon usage, cohesive with brand style
This ensures clarity for stadium event staff who rely on both on-screen navigation and paper show-flows.
